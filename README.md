# Overview

Hi ðŸ‘‹

I'm Kristopher Mazzini, undergraduate student in Electrical Engineering at UFJF! This project is part of my graduation thesis whose goal is to develop
a controlled robotic vehicle to be used by children with cerebral palsy. 

The control system must allow the children to command the vehicle according to their own will, however, due to complications caused by the disability, 
such as muscle spasms, it must also asure that the children will never put themselves - or find themselves - in any kind of dangerous situation.

# Instructions for using the simulations in this project

- You are going to need MATLAB and CoppeliaSim installed
- Verify if the files "remApi.m", "remoteApi.dylib" and "remoteApiProto.m" are compatible with your OS and hardware. Visit the pages below for further
information:

  - https://www.coppeliarobotics.com/helpFiles/en/remoteApiClientSide.htm
- Open CoppeliaSim and run the desired scene.
- Run the file "app.m" in MATLAB.
